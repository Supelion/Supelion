Hey there! <img src="https://media.giphy.com/media/hvRJCLFzcasrR4ia7z/giphy.gif" width="15px">

I'm **Supelion**, an aspiring developer. I love music!

I am an intermediate Python developer and I am relatively new to programming. On my github page, you'll find some of the projects I've worked on. Most of them are made in Python as it's the only language that I understand.

    I'm currently: 
    
    Developing my Discord bot
    Learning JavaScript


I have a goal of making as much open-source software possible, because **fuck writing your own code.**
